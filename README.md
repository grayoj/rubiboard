# Rubiboard

This is an open sourced version of a dashboard UI used internally at a firm I worked, directed at businesses to basically manage their logistics and riders. It would be updated routinely, since we essentially use this in prod.

## Features

- Built on top of Vite (So it's a hella fast)
- Uses Typescript. 
- Uses the SWC Rust based bundler. Faster than Webpack.
- Uses React* (Basically all client side components)
- Preloaders.
- React-Router-Dom
- Animations and SVG Icons.
- Uses rechart.
- Tailwindcss for the entire UI.
- Multi-step form.
