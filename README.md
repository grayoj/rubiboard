# Rubiboard

This is an open sourced version of a dashboard UI used internally at a firm I worked, directed at businesses to basically manage their logistics and riders. It would be updated routinely, since we essentially use this in prod.

## Features

1. Built on top of Vite (So it's a hella fast)
2. Uses Typescript. 
3. Uses the SWC Rust based bundler. Faster than Webpack.
4. Uses React* (Basically all client side components)
5. Preloaders.
6. React-Router-Dom
7. Animations and SVG Icons.
8. Uses rechart.
9. Tailwindcss for the entire UI.
10. Multi-step form.
